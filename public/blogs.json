    "description": " Preventative care is an often overlooked but an important part of young men's health. Seeing your doctor once a year for an annual physical can seem like a burden when you're a healthy teenage boy, but it's a great opportunity to check in, make sure all is well, and clear you for the upcoming school year, sports season, work, or camp. Yet, unless prompted by their parents, teenage boys and young men are notorious for skipping this visit.”"

    "description": " This is going to surprise a lot of people, but teens should really be getting eight to 10 hours of sleep every night,” says Elizabeth Rainville, PA-C, a physician assistant in Penn Medicine's Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine Department. Why so much? Through age 20, Rainville says, men and women are finishing the advanced stages of puberty and men are still physically growing. These things require a lot of energy, and we restore our energy levels primarily through sleep. Not getting enough sleep may put you at a higher risk of diabetes and long-term heart problems."
